			   <p>Conceived in the year 2013, what is known today, as the Ogbunike Cave Carnival (OCC) was first staged on December 31, 2013
			   as health walk/mini carnival dubbed Ogbunikewalk4life. Aside from using the platform to promote healthy living among youths of the community,
			   the initiative aims at drawing attention of the government to the popular Ogbunike Cave, as well as celebrate itâ€™s tourism potentials.

               Unlike the maiden edition, the 2014 carnival, which was staged on December 31, attracted guests and tourists from different parts of the state,
               who joined in the carnival float that moved round the street of Ogbunike, with a brief stop at the Round Palace of Igwe Ogbunike,
               HRH Ositadimma Umenyiora (Ezedioramma 1 of Ogbunike).</p>

			   <b>Ogbunike Cave Carnival  2</b>
			   
               <p>With the level of participation and success story of the second edition, it became necessary to expand the carnival 
			      into a Three-Day celebration that offers Five Aside Football Competition, Sport Parade, Walk4life (Carnival Float), 
			      New Year Countdown/Carnival Concert, Ada Ogbunike Beauty Pageant (Carnival Queen) and Carnival Lecture, 
			      which sets the tone for the yearly feast.

                  Coincidentally, few months after the maiden edition in 2013, the Executive Governor of Anambra State,
                  Chief Willie Obiano made a bold step to invest in the tourism destination, which he plans to build up to international standards.</p>
